Release early, release often! Nearly one week after the 3.2.2 version, here comes a new release, focused on only one new feature : access AjaXplorer repositories via the webDAV protocol. Based on a PHP implementation of webDAV, this does not require specific server configuration, takes full advantage of existing users and access rights of AjaXplorer, and make the files accessible to a wide variety of GUI client ! Mount the repositories as network drives on desktop computers, or access the files using the webdav client of your choice on the mobile phones terminals.

Upgrade is not necessary if you do not plan to use this feature. But people willing to install, test and report problems, are welcome! A full HOW-TO is available in the documentation : http://www.ajaxplorer.info/wordpress/documentation-3/chapter-howtos/7-4-setup-the-webdav-server-access/

[Upgrade]

Only a couple of "AJXP_WEBDAV_" configurations options appear in the server/conf/conf.php file, otherwise should be totally compatible with previous version. On the config side, the is a new "slug" concept added to the repository objects, wich implies a new column for conf.sql users : simply add slug VARCHAR(255) to the ajxp_repo table.

Please support this software by a donation. You can also hire me for specific developement on the AjaXplorer base : team (at) ajaxplorer (dot) info. Or the very minimal support would be to spread the word on Facebook, vote for AjaXplorer on Sourceforge or Freshmeat!
